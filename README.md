# How to Generate .jar file
- if you already download another java version (newer), you don't need to update

- if you already download another java version (< v17), then you need to install newer version, and run this command
    ```
        update-java-alternatives --list
        sudo update-java-alternatives --set <path to new java version>
        java -version
    ```

- if you didn't already download java
    1. on your wsl/mac/ubuntu, download java jdk 17
        ```
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk openjdk-17-jre
        ```
    2. install maven
        ```
            sudo apt-get install maven
        ```
    3. run `mvn clean install`

# How to add .jar extensions to your keycloak
> Please Note, if you want individuals custom extensions, please copy paste the extensions you want and generate the jar file yourself.
> the .jar file that created here all to install all of the custom extensions.
> after that you need to rebuild the image using `docker-compose bulid --no-cache keycloak`

1. go to your docker-compose.yml
2. on keycloak service, add this line on your keycloak service
    ```
    # example
    volumes:
      - ./target/<your-extension>.jar:/opt/keycloak/providers/extensions.jar
    ```
3. run `docker-compose up -d keycloak` to rebuild your keycloak service
